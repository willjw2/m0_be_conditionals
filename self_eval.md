# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
> I feel pretty confident in my understanding and fluency with comparison operators

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
> I feel confident in logical operators

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
> I feel fairly confident with if statements, I just need to remember to put end at the end of the branches

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
> I spent a  lot more time on this than my initial time estimate of an hour, probably spent closer to 2 or so

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
> I still need to learn some more operators like % that was needed for the second code challenge, but I don't think I need to adjust my calendar for that as I'll probably learn things like that as necessary when problems demand it like in this case.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
> In my recording, I ended up coming up with two different approaches to solving coding challenge 3, and I'm not sure which one is better. I think that maybe one is more efficient and that using nested if statements is less efficient? At any rate I don't think that this is something too important for now.
